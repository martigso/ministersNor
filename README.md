ministersNor is an R package developed for reproducibility. The package contains the data and code used for the Master's thesis "Survival of the ministers: On ministerial durability in post-war Norway".

How to get the data:

* R users can simply run `install_github(martigso/ministersNor)`, then access the data by using `library(ministersNor)` and `data(ministers)`
* Other users can find the data in .csv format at https://github.com/martigso/ministersNor/raw/master/data/ministers_alt.csv (right click this link and press "save as")

The documentation and online appendix is available within the package for R users, and at https://github.com/martigso/ministersNor/tree/master/inst/doc for other users
